# Untitled Game Idea

## Premise

The setting is during the Anglo-Zulu war. A lone Zulu warrior has to fight off hoards of red-coats who have superior fire-power. What they don’t know, however, is this oak is not to be messed with.

Picture doom-slayer but from Africa. He is able to block and dodge bullets and can take troops out with one swing of his short spear.

The creation of this game is an exercise in learning Nvim, low level game development and C.
